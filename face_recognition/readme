First:
-read through the How_to_install_face_recognition document to install needed software

Second:
-download face_recognition_1camera.py
this runs facial recgonition off of one raspberry pie camera. 
It pops up a window that shows live videostream. When it recognizes a face it puts a box around it and if it knows who it is puts their name underneath

Training photos must be in the same folder as the .py script

Third:
-download photos of Becca, Rohit, and Nathan labeled becca.jpg, rohit.jpg, and nathan.jpg, comment out any other names in the code that you don't have photos of

Fourth:
- run code with python3 face_recognition_1camera.py


Still figuring this out:
flaskask.py is where all of the alexa commands will go. Right now it reads in the person's name that the facerec code is recognizing.
Alexa command: Alexa who am I? You are ___
