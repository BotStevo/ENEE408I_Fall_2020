First:
-read through the How_to_install_face_recognition document to install needed software

Second:
-download facerec.py
this runs facial recgonition off of one raspberry pie camera. 
It pops up a window that shows live videostream. When it recognizes a face it puts a box around it and if it knows who it is puts their name underneath


Third:
-download photos of Becca, Rohit, and Nathan labeled becca.jpg, rohit.jpg, and nathan.jpg, comment out any other names in the code that you don't have photos of
Training photos must be in the same folder as the .py script

Fourth:
- make a skill in the developer consol that asks who is in the camera. Mine is "Alexa ask Johnny Five who do you see"

Fifth:
- run ./ngrok http 5000 in separate terminal
- change the endpoint in the developer consol to the correct address

Sixth:
- run python3 main.py

This will run flask ask and facerec as two separate threads at the same time. Any time you ask Alexa the question you set in step 4 it wil respond with "I see 'your name'" or "I see unknown"


Common errors: 

Error: "Invalid camera device specified..."
Solution: It didn't recognize your camera on start up, so type "reboot" in the terminal to restart the jetson
