# ENEE408I_Fall_2020
Shared repository for students in the ENEE408I Fall 2020 offering

## Usage
Each team should have a folder team1, team2, etc.

[This tutorial](https://www.neonscience.org/git-setup-remote) is good for learning how to maintain your Git repo.
**Note 1:** You do not need to fork this repo (since you were given write access).
**Note 2:** After cloning should create, checkout, and work on your own branch instead of main. See the [Git Command Cheatsheet](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf).
**Note 3:** The `gitk` command will easily visualize the git tree. `gitk --all` will show you an even more detailed tree. Install with `sudo apt install gitk`.
**Note 4:** When you are ready to share your work with the class through the `main` branch, a good way is to make a Pull Request. For example this file was commited with Pull Request #1. You can then comment on the pull request and have a discussion.

Remember sharing your code with teammates is encouraged! If setup right your teammates can even import code from another teams folder instead of copy-pasting it.
